# Digital_Twin_Cyber_II
Repository for Homework 2 and 3. 

To run this extension you need to have a server.py running with files located in the same Chrome Extension directory

This code also assumes that you are running it on a localhost and uses the loopback address. If it is ran on a server on a network the portion of code in the popup.js taht refers to the IP will need to be rewritten to reflect that.

The Chrome Extension folder holds all the code needed for running the digital twin and also some code used to test its function

The DTClassifier folder holds the code and data used to craft the models.
